IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

As a hobby project I am creating a Magic Mirror. To power this mirror currently takes 4 plugs, one for the monitor, raspberry pi, leds, and speaker charger. I would like to create and implement the necessary power electronics (should just be a step down transformer and buck convertor with whatever electronics to support them) to be able to only have one plug for the mirror, which then supplies all the different loads.

## Educational Value Added

As an Energy and Power Electronic Systems this is right up my majors alley. Step down transformers and buck convertors are buliding blocks of power electronics so this project will give me hands-on experience in creating these.
